# BERTopic Application Improvements

## Overview
Comprehensive improvements have been implemented to create a scalable BERTopic application that works equally well on small (50 docs) and large (100K+ docs) datasets while producing high-quality topic categories.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Adaptive Parameter System
The application now automatically adjusts parameters based on dataset size:

- **Small datasets (<500 docs)**:
  - Uses K-means clustering to guarantee topics (no outliers)
  - Reduced UMAP neighbors and components
  - Smaller minimum topic sizes
  - Lower vocabulary requirements

- **Medium datasets (500-5000 docs)**:
  - Balanced HDBSCAN parameters
  - Moderate UMAP settings
  - Standard vocabulary size

- **Large datasets (5000+ docs)**:
  - Full HDBSCAN with optimized parameters
  - Low-memory UMAP mode
  - Larger vocabulary and feature extraction

### 2. Advanced Embedding Models
- Integrated SentenceTransformers for better document embeddings
- Adaptive model selection:
  - `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for small/medium datasets (faster)
  - `all-mpnet-base-v2` for large datasets (more accurate)

### 3. Representation Model Chain
Implemented KeyBERTInspired + MaximalMarginalRelevance for better topic quality:
- **KeyBERTInspired**: Extracts keywords that best represent topics
- **MaximalMarginalRelevance**: Balances relevance and diversity (30% diversity)
- Results in clearer, more meaningful topic descriptions

### 4. Intelligent Outlier Reduction
Multi-strategy approach based on dataset size:
- Probability-based reduction (primary)
- c-TF-IDF reduction (secondary)
- Adaptive thresholds based on dataset size
- Only applied when outliers exceed acceptable threshold

### 5. Enhanced UI/UX
- Real-time dataset size detection and feedback
- Topic quality metrics display
- Interactive topic selector with document counts
- Expandable view for all topics
- Clean, scrollable document display
- Coverage percentage indicator

### 6. Removed Problematic Features
- Removed sentiment-based topic separation (was causing issues)
- Simplified to unified topic modeling approach
- Focus on topic quality rather than sentiment splitting

## Technical Details

### Clustering Strategy
```python
if dataset_size < 500:
    # K-means for guaranteed topics
    clustering = KMeans(n_clusters=adaptive_n)
else:
    # HDBSCAN with outlier reduction
    clustering = HDBSCAN(adaptive_params)
```

### Vocabulary Optimization
```python
# Adaptive vocabulary based on size
if small: max_features = 500
elif medium: max_features = 2000
else: max_features = 5000
```

### Parameter Scaling
- **n_neighbors**: 2-15 (small) → 15-30 (medium) → 30+ (large)
- **n_components**: 3-5 (small) → 5-10 (medium) → 10+ (large)
- **min_cluster_size**: 2-5 (small) → 5-50 (medium) → 50+ (large)

## Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Works effectively from 50 to 100,000+ documents
2. **Quality**: Better topic coherence through advanced representation models
3. **Coverage**: Minimized outliers through intelligent reduction
4. **Performance**: Adaptive parameters prevent memory issues
5. **Usability**: Clear UI with helpful metrics and navigation

## Usage Notes

- The app automatically detects dataset size and optimizes accordingly
- No manual parameter tuning needed for most use cases
- Seed words still supported for domain-specific guidance
- Download results include topic assignments for further analysis

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add topic coherence metrics (NPMI, C_v)
2. Implement hierarchical topic modeling for large datasets
3. Add topic evolution tracking over time
4. Include topic similarity visualization
5. Export topic model for reuse
